I have fully implemented the requirements in my project as follows:

1- Created three sets of buttons as highlighted in section 1 of the picture in red.

2- Added an On Hover effect for each button so that when the mouse hovers over it or the button is touched on a device, the button is highlighted with a colored border, just like the Play button shown in the picture.

3-The Hand element moves to the button that the cursor is hovering over, enhancing the interactive feel.

4- I also added sound effects that play when the cursor hovers over the buttons to improve user feedback.

5- I created an idle animation for the UI element shown in section 3 of the picture, including moving clouds to add dynamic visual effects.
